# Exhibition Curator

## Context (real or imagined business situation)

You have always dreamt of being a curator of antiquities and fine artworks, and now you have been approached by a coalition of museums and universities, who want to create viewer driven virtual exhibitions from their combined catalogues. This will be of great use to researchers, students, and art lovers alike. 

## Assumptions and Prerequisites

1. You will use at least two separate Museum or University free APIs to request information about their collections. It is for you to research which APIs you will use in advance of starting this project.
2. You may need to sign up for additional services, please ensure you are using free, developer tiers of any services you sign up for. 

## High-level desired outcome

Users of the platform can enter key terms or choose from presets which will provide them with a list of artworks to select from. The selected artworks will then be added to a personalised exhibition. When viewed, the exhibition should include images and information associated each curated them. Users can navigate between different artworks, and should be provided with links where they can find out more information, and where they can see the artwork in person. 

## Minimum viable product

A website or a web progressive app (WAP) where:

1. a user can provide some search criteria to filter and sort artworks. 
2. the artworks can then be saved into a temporary collection, which can be viewed and expanded. 
3. images and core information about the artwork are displayed when a user interacts with a thumbnail or other indicator of an artwork from the exhibition. 
4. the user can select which artworks they want to include in an exhibition they are creating which persists for the duration of their session.

## Non functional requirement

- Built using JavaScript or TypeScript. 
- Responsive design.
- Accessibility taken into consideration.
- Fast loading of high quality media content, or indication of loading times to the user. 
- Hosted on a free distribution platform.
- The code should include clear and detailed documentation, which includes details on where the project is hosted and explicit steps on how it can be ran locally.

## Performance criteria

The app should clearly communicate to users errors, if they occur, or if content is still loading. The design should be clear and obvious as to how to create a curated exhibition and how to view it.  

## Non-binding tech suggestions

- React 
- React Native
- TypeScript

4. Possible extensions

- permanence of exhibitions through a user profile and a non-relational BE to save favourite search combinations
- unique shareable links 
- both a website and a mobile app
- social media integration
- multiple search and filter criteria 

## Due date

To be advised, but not later than four weeks from commencement. Please note that you must host this project, and that you must provide clear documentation on how the project can be ran locally. Omitting these two steps can result in this project being unsuccessful.
